        Check that Build Action is Content.
        Content: Allows you to retrieve a file (in same dir as assembly) as a stream via Application.GetContentStream( uri ). For this method to work, it needs a AssemblyAssociatedContentFile custom attribute which VS graciously adds when you mark a file as "Content"
        None: The file is not included in the project output group and is not compiled in the build process. An example is a text file that contains documentation, such as a Readme file.
        Compile: The file is compiled into the build output. This setting is used for code files.
        Embedded resource: embeds the file in an exclusive assembly manifest resource.
        Page: Used to compile a xaml file into baml. The baml is then embedded with the same technique as Resource (i.e. available as `AppName.g.resources)
        ApplicationDefinition: Mark the XAML/class file that defines your application. You specify the code-behind with the x:Class="Namespace.ClassName" and set the startup form/page with StartupUri="Window1.xaml"
        CodeAnalysisDictionary: A xml file containing custom word dictionary for spelling rules
