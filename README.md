**MemoryGame** 

A fairly complex Microsoft Blend tutorial. Originally created for Visual Studio 2013. Converted to a Visual Studio 2015 Universal Windows App. Sample code not available anymore. Tutorial steps are located at: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj129462(v=vs.110).aspx.


**UWP.Petzold**

Converts the samples in "Programming Windows Sixth Edition Writing Windows 8 Apps with C# and XAML" by Charles Petzold to UWP. Each chapter has its own project. Each project was created using the UWPShellTemplate at  https://github.com/ronlemire2/UWPProjectTemplates. Each sample has its own Page in the Views folder. Most of the samples are exactly as they were written by Charles Petzold. A few samples are my own variation on the original but have the same output. These variations have names that begin with 'rjl'.
